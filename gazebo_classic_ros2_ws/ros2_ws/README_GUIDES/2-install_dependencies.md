# Installing Dependencies
In order to run this simulation framework, you must install the appropriate dependencies. To start off, you'll need:

## 1. ROS2 Iron.
This simulation is distro-speific. Although Iron is EOL Nov2024, it is what was used for this simulation. You can download [iron here](https://docs.ros.org/en/iron/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html).

**NOTE :** I've heard that ROS2 Humble will work with Gazebo Classic natively and is still recieving updates. You could probably use humble, but I can't guarantee it will all work if you do.

**WARNING:** If you need to use a different ROS distro that doesn't support Gazebo Classic, this simulation won't work. You can adapt it to your distro, but it won't be a small undertaking.

## 2. Gazebo (classic)
**This will not work with Gazebo Ignition or Gazebo Harmonic**. Everything is in Gazebo classic, so use Gazebo Classic. The plugins that use "gz" or "ign" are not supported.
    1. Install the wrapper:
        sudo apt install ros-iron-gazebo-ros-pkgs
            This gives you the 'gazebo' command.
            This works with .urdf and .xacro files that use <gazebo> tags.

    2. Install the "extras". You probably already have these from the last command, but to be safe:
        sudo apt install ros-iron-xacro ros-iron-robot-state-publisher ros-iron-joint-state-publisher
    
    3. Install the teleop twist controller. It allows manual control of robot from your keyboard:
        sudo apt install ros-iron-teleop-twist-keyboard
    4. Source the build:
        source install/setup.bash
    5. Verify Install:
        ros2 launch gazebo_ros gazebo.launch.py 
            gray grid and blue sky
        ros2 topic list         
            You should see /clock, /parameter_events, and /performance_metrics

## 3. RViz
Rviz is what allows you to "see" what the robot "sees". 
    1. Probably installed already if you installed got ros-iron-desktop when you first got ROS2, but to be safe:
        sudo apt install ros-iron-rviz2

These are the 3 main dependencies. That's it!
